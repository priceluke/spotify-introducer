# Spotify-Introducer
Node Spotify song announcer/introducer. Created to practice working with JS & APIs but also because I'm terrible at learning the names of songs and thought this may help.

It is a standalone application and simply uses AJAX to retrieve the current song, pause it, announce the song, and then continue.
